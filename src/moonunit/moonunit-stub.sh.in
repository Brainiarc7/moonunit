$name -- Mu test loading stub generator

  This script scans C source code files for Mu unit tests
  and generates a test loading stub.  This stub allows MoonUnit
  to load unit tests without scanning symbols in your library
  at runtime (an operation which is highly platform-dependent
  and less portable).

Usage: $name [-o <outfile>] [<name>=<value> ...] source1.c source2.c ...
  -o <file>           Write output to <file> (defaults to stdout)
  -?,-h,--help        Display this usage information
  <name>=<value>      Set an environment variable for the duration of
                      this script (e.g. CPPFLAGS)

Environment variables:
  CPP                 The C preprocessor program to invoke (default: cpp)
  CPPFLAGS            Additional flags to pass to the C preprocessor
